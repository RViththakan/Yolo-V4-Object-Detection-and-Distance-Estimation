**Introduction**

This project combines YOLOv4 (You Only Look Once version 4) object detection with a distance estimation algorithm to detect objects in real-time and estimate their distance from the camera. YOLOv4 is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that achieves high accuracy and speed. The distance estimator uses the size of the detected objects to infer their distance from the camera based on known object dimensions.

**Features**

1.Real-time object detection using YOLOv4\
2.Distance estimation for detected objects\
3.Supports multiple classes of objects\
4.Easy-to-use interface for running detection and distance estimation
